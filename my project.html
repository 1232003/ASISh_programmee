    <img src="e.png" width="400" height="400">
    <p><strong>HTML version 2.0 was developed in 1995 with basic intention of improving HTML version 1.0
        Now a standard got started to develop so as to maintain common rules and regulations across different browsers. HTML 2.0 has improved a lot in terms of the markup tags. In HTML 2.0 version concept of form came into force. Forms were developed, but still, they had basic tags like text boxes, buttons, etc.
        Also, the table came as an HTML tag. Now, in HTML tag 2.0, browsers also came with the concept of creating their own layers of tags that were specific to the browser itself. W3C was also formed. The main intention of W3C is to maintain standard across different web browsers so that these browsers understand and render HTML tags in a similar manner.</strong></p>
